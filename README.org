* Cemacs
A multithreaded, Emacs using compiled Common Lisp as a configration language

** Features/Limitations
- Common lisp configuration language
- Most programming modes and very basic org-mode
- Git support with libgit2
- SSH editing
- No dependencies, C POSIX libraries

- Potentially 

** Differences from GNU/Emacs
- My Common lisp is compiled, not interpreted (idk how to make an interpreter) (it's kind of like the suckless editor)
- Only tested on FreeBSD, but others should work
- Terminal only
- It's basically just a rewrite of my GNU/Emacs config, but every thing is built in
- That's it ig
